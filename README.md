# Online Store - bsale

# Objectives

Build an online store that displays products grouped by category, generating separately backend (REST API) and frontend and using the database that is available to its development.

In addition, you have to add a search engine, which has to be implemented at the server, through an API Rest whose language and framework can be free choice.

The front-end must be developed with vanilla javascript without any framework, the use of libraries, components
specific, such as; bootstrap, material, Jquery, among others are allowed.

Finally, make the application and the repository available with the code and the hosting.

The front-end was built using react's library using a redux structure.

is the front-end project for the Ruby on Rails back-end. Here the end points from the back-end are consumed and rendered. The items are rendered from the requests done to end points from the back-end.
The project consist on building a online store where products can be displayed by categories.
It is possible to search by categories, price, and/or name, all this has to be implemented in the back-end. Additionally, it is possible to add items to the cart, erase them one by one add more products, or erase the whole cart with a single click.

As part of the proyect its is needed to deploy it, for the front-end it was used Netlity (it may take some minutes to load, since the back end takes some time when it's not used)
[Netlify-Deployment](https://61b6c8a4e5d4a6d1def961bb--competent-mcnulty-9b9b65.netlify.app/)
It may take some time for the page to load since Heroku also needs time to load the back-end.

  ### **Endpoints of API**

  | Method | Endpoint   |      Functionality |
  | ------ | ---------- | -----------------: |
  | GET    | products   |   Get the products |
  | GET    | categories | Get the categories |
  | GET    | search     |     Get the search |

  There are 3 current endpoints that are currently working.

  For example in the local environment the BASEURL will be : http://localhost:3000/

  - Get BASE_URL+products, the request to this end point will give a response with all the products in the database
  - Get BASE_URL+categories, the request to this end point will give a response with all the categories from the product in the database.
  - Get BASE_URL+search, the request is a string with all the different search arguments you need ( name, price, discount or any category from the menu)
